Shared `Nat`-level modular-arithmetic lemmas used by `HexArith` proofs.

Lean's standard library already exposes the basic divisibility, mod, and gcd
API; this file collects the small lemmas that it lacks but the Barrett and
Montgomery proof layers need. Today that is the single coprimality fact
that an odd modulus is coprime to every power of two; the shape required by
Montgomery inversion over `R = 2^k`.

An odd number is coprime to every power of two. Montgomery inversion uses this
exact named lemma to discharge the `Nat.Coprime p (2 ^ k)` side condition for
the radix `R = 2^k`.
